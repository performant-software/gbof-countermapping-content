Counter mapping allows for individuals to express an alternative way of mapping areas that

differs from traditional governance methods of mapping. In the case of this counter-mapping

project, Pace Students Ellis Clay and Shalini Basu depict mutual aid efforts in the city for

underrepresented groups in traditional governance. Through their blog posts, they discuss how

despite not being large-scale governmental efforts or larger nonprofit organizations, these mutual

aid groups support communities in New York City, relying on those within the community to

come together. For example, the Norwood Community Library located on East Gun Hill Road

between Wayne and Bainbridge Avenue, provides for its community by creating an accessible

spot for education resources for those who may need it. While it may not be a large-scale

organization or foundation providing resources, this small community library supports its

community and allows for neighbors to come together to continue this support. By mapping

these projects and mutual aid groups, they are able to show how accessible this support can be in

our own neighborhoods and where others can be involved. While you may not be able to turn

around tomorrow and become a politician to see change, you can take a look at the map they’ve

created and choose to join a group in your area that may benefit you and your community.

Activism may seem somewhat hopeless to everyday civilians, especially in under-represented

communities, however maps such as Clay and Basu’s highlight ways in which you can step in

and support your own community. Counter-mapping in this way makes change and activism a

much more personal experience, bringing back power in numbers and in community. From

community fridges to migrant aid, the website provides a variety of resources for mutual aid

groups that you can choose to take part in depending on what matters to you. Exploring groups

like this in your own neighborhood is a great way to make an impact on potentially

underrepresented groups that matter most to you. Traditional government has unfortunately

become something overrun with those with an abundance of resources financially, straying from

its original goal of being a representation of the majority of citizens in our nation. As we’ve

spoken about this semester, large industries and corporations are able to rewrite the narrative in

our nation politically, and by stepping up and giving back to your own personal community, we

can support our neighbors and environment through a sense of community lost upon higher

government. You don’t need an excess of funds or materials to support mutual aid groups such as

those listed on this map, just a purpose and a goal to better your community one step at a time
