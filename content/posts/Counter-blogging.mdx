Hello readers! I am Professor Nayak, a professor of Political Science & Chair of Women's and Gender Studies at Pace University.

I wanted to participate in this project of building this website so as to undo/unlearn what we usually learn about people and places. I asked my research assistants (Shalini Basu & Ellis Clay) and students in my Introduction to International Relations course to respond to this prompt, with instructions that allow "counter-blogging." In other words, blogs are not always just our thoughts and reactions. They are ways to confront, resist, and upend what we are supposed to think and say. They are ways to show that our words are always in conversation with other words--words published and unpublished by the most marginalized communities--on whose unceded lands we live, work, and study, on whose unmarked graves we walk to our classes.

PROMPT:

You will write a post of 300-500 words. In this post, you are going to reflect on the visualization in the map to answer the prompt: "What does counter-mapping teach us about alternative models of governance?" and use concrete examples to explain. The blog may be in narrative form, like any other blog post you may see out there. BUT you may also feel free to be creative--you can write a poem, actually visit a site on the map and do a "visual tour" (along the lines of the visual/sound project), write fiction or futurist speculative prose (such as imagining what it might look like if mutual aid replaced all forms of governance!), or a mini comic strip.

\*\*\*If you would like to participate by writing a blog post to be considered for publication, please write to me!
