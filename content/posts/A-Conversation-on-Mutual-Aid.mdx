*Shalini Basu & Ellis Clay were the research assistants for this project and reflect upon what they learned during this process. They reference the Urban Indigenous Collective, a community partner with Dr. Nayak, the Women's and Gender Studies Department, and the Pace Ground Beneath Our Feet Initiative-a faculty-led attempt to understand and connect with the land we are on and the communities surrounding us. We are sharing this website with Urban Indigenous Collective as a way to show our gratitude to and for all visitors and stewards of this area, as a means of solidarity with Indigenous groups who have always led the way on mutual aid, community governance, and counter-mapping*)

[Ellis + Shalini Conversation Recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14dt_NJ0PRCboM3TcXMVNySQErqUC2fJU/view?usp=sharing "Ellis + Shalini Mutual Aid Blog Post")

Shalini : Hi I'm Shalini

Ellis: Hi I'm Ellis and we are here to talk about
mutual aid organizations we pulled together for the mutual aid mapping for the
urban indigenous collective. So to start with our first question I have for you,
Shalini, what was your experience researching these mutual aid groups, what did
you find compelling?

Shalini : I think in general I think I didn't expect
to learn as much about the city as I did. I think researching these mutual aid
groups really illustrated to me how many different communities there are and
how many different needs there are for each community. I just feel like the
knowledge I gained from this experience will be taken with me through future
endeavors. I’m really, really thankful for it.

Ellis: Yeah, and to add onto that point which I think
was really beautifully worded, I, for myself, found when doing research for
these different organizations the community oriented and the services they're
offering from like providing groceries for free or pulling people together to
bring them to appointments and stuff like it's those simple actions I feel that
we sometimes forget. But these orgs are doing that really important work and
not having to be compensated in a financial way which I just found really
beautiful.

Shalini:  I think it yeah exactly I think it showed me like if you really want to help like
you can and you don't need, you don't need a ton of funding you don't need to
like wait for somebody to give you the opportunity to help like you can just
start helping your community. And I think along those lines I felt almost
emotional doing a lot of this research because there's so much good community
out there and I feel like I personally always think that community is not being
very well preserved and we're kind of losing out on what community really means
and it's just it's inspiring that so many of there's so many groups that are
preserving that community in such positive ways. And  yeah I just feel like emotional and thinking
about it.

Ellis: Oh if you can hear my snaps! I'm just snapping
to that point right there!

 Shalini:  What were your biggest takeaways from this experience?

Ellis:  I think like I always thought mutual aid organizations had a location that you could go
to physically but doing this research taught me that not all of them do. Some
were very like quiet about the location, “if you know, you know,” which I found
to be like interesting on its own but also highlighted the importance of doing this
type of work but having to be acknowledged and knowing that you can't always be
public about it was really interesting.  I think another big take away for me, I feel like I had a lot of this, was that we
can't always rely on nonprofit organizations to do the work we want them to do.
We have to rely on ourselves and like by ourselves I mean community who's
really going to be actively there for us that aren't relying on grant funding
and so forth.

Shalini: I think it's a really positive way of
combatting the nonprofit industrial complex. I remember taking a class on it
and I just remember feeling so downtrodden by like even the nonprofit world. I
think I grew up thinking that that was like the safe haven and that was where
like the good work is being done. And that's not to say that good work isn't
being done in nonprofit organizations, but it does come with a plethora of
problems and to know that there is mutual aid that can be also productive and
it's for the people by the people. That point you made about how this locations
aren't always disclosed was actually a really interesting thing that I came
across as well. I do kind of like that some of these groups make it like just
their community and like you kind of have to be physically near that location
to know where it is. And I think there is something really, really productive
about keeping it kind of close and closed that way. Like yeah I guess like you
actually know everyone who's in your community you know everyone who's part of
the group I think that can be really, really special.

Ellis: I fully agree with that. I think my last
question for Shalini, and it's a question for myself, do you see in your life you
being a part of mutual aid group postgrad as we go to this next chapter of our
lives?

Shalini: I think I could see myself being part of a
mutual group. I think this experience has definitely inspired me. I really
resonated with just the idea of like a community fridge and like community
library. I think we've talked about this before but I could so see that being
like even in the near future. Also just learning how accessible doing stuff
like this is, again, you don't need a lot of funding you literally just need a community
fridge! Like it can be that easy. I feel like I'm using the same words but like
it is really inspiring that helping can be so simple.

Ellis: Those are really inspiring words. Now I’m
using inspiring! But no, I like fully get you there because I, for myself, I
had always viewed like working for mutual aid- not like working but like
working with mutual aid as a volunteer and doing that was something so far away
from me. Because I thought it was big time like “I'm a big-time organizer and
activist” like it wasn't really meant for the common person. But I think that
idea for me has been like pushed away by doing this type of research and seeing
like “Oh my God no we can do this tomorrow if I want to.” Like everyone is open
to join and be a part of this really important experience. So, I'm hoping like
wherever I move next, I can really like dive deep into a mutual aid group and do
really important work on the ground.

Shalini: That’s amazing!

Ellis: Do you have anything else you want to say?

Shalini: I think just kind of on that point like it
doesn't have to be something that like is your primary job. Like literally
anybody of any occupation, any age, any whatever! Like anyone can be part of
mutual aid which I think is the really special part of it.

Ellis: It’s like extremely accessible which I
absolutely adore! Well, Shalini, thank you so much for joining me for this
conversation!

Shalini: Thank you! And thank you to everyone
listening!
