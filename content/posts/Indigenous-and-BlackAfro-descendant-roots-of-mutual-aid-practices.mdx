Multiple Indigenous tribes and nations use the principles of reciprocity and care, in part due to ancestral practices having to do with valuing interconnectedness of all living beings but also interdependence between generations, and in part to needing to survive white supremacy and settler colonialism. At the same time, Black and Afro-descendant communities also utilize principles of reciprocity and care to model "solidarity not charity" (see, for example the history of the Black Panthers in the U.S.) so as to break down hierarchies of "the giver" and "the recipient."

The histories and trajectories of mutual aid are messier than the aforementioned simple sentences. Sometimes mutual aid networks emerge organically to deal with certain crises, like during the height of the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. and the COVID-19 pandemic globally, when resource-sharing and acts of intimacy (like taking care of ailing bodies) arose as people realized that governments and usual modes of governance were not going to care for the most vulnerable people. And sometimes, formal governance structures intentionally exclude groups (people who are undocumented, of certain groups, etc) from policies that meet community needs.

But wait! It's not enough to say "I'm part of mutual aid!" by joining or building a network. We must be attentive to the lessons like:

1. POWER:  is there actually reciprocity and the building of community, or is it charity/savior-mentality in the language of mutual aid? If there's one set of people who are always sharing resources, perhaps it's appropriate to explicitly start talking about reparations. Maybe it's a redistribution of resources. Maybe there needs to be "nested circles" of mutual aid. For example, as a U.S. citizen with secure housing, I am in the position of giving supplies to a mutual aid network I'm a part of that shares resources with people who just arrived to the country and are very precariously situated. At the moment, I do not need resources FROM the people who just arrived--they are IN the asylum process and are legally allowed to be in the country but they are still seen as "illegals." I need to be aware that there may not be "reciprocity" between us, but rather that the reciprocal care-giving is happening among and between families living in awful conditions at Floyd Bennett. But, I'm starting to build relationships (that are lopsided), and one family was relocated to my neighborhood. A few of us are arranging playdates so that kids can get to know each other and feel a bit more comfortable, and so that the children of those who give resources are building relationships where reciprocity can happen (the kind that occurs between children). It's not enough. I can't fool myself into thinking it's enough. We are trying to build a different kind of governance because we know formal governance structures are allowing great harm to come to these families.
2. MAPS: Counter-mapping may mean leaving uncharted or unmarked certain areas. It might be dangerous to some people for others to know where they are. For example, several people angry that the U.S. has asylum seeking families so close to home, protested when the families at Floyd Bennett were moved to a nearby high school during life threatening floods. We put Floyd Bennett on the map, but that's where we are leaving it. We do not have on our map all the intricate lines and routes one would see on mainstream maps of New York City. Mutual aid happens in so many spaces and forums. Counter-mapping reveals the limits of our knowledge about what is happening around us.
3. GIVING CREDIT: When engaging with mutual aid, I am committed to giving credit to Indigenous and Black/Afro-descendant communities who engage regularly in this PRAXIS of reciprocity, solidarity, and community-building--and by being specific instead of painting Indigenous and Black/Afro-descendant communities with one broad brush. I'm trying to revisit the resources we provided so I know who to cite and give credit to. Some people see mutual aid as complementary to formal governance structures, whereas others see it as an "abolitionist" mode of living, where the goal is to "replace" governance structures with mutual aid networks, whereby mutual aid is "oppositional" to formal governance. Here's an example of abolitionist thinking: [https://www.blackagendareport.com/bar-abolition-mutual-aid-spotlight-alisa-bierria](https://www.blackagendareport.com/bar-abolition-mutual-aid-spotlight-alisa-bierria). And here's an example of complementary thinking: [https://mutualaid.nyc/](https://mutualaid.nyc/) where you will see a grouping of mutual aid networks, nonprofit organizations, and even state agencies under the broader idea of "building communities of care". Scroll through and digest what is being described on each website. Which approach resonates with you? Sometimes registered nonprofit organizations engage in mutual aid within the organization and/or regarding the communities they serve, even integrating mutual aid praxis in the work they do--but they are still nonprofits with paid job positions and sometimes hierarchies, and thus were not classified as mutual aid networks as we entered data on this website. Some nonprofits do operate in a less hierarchical manner and prioritize community-building, reciprocity, and mutual aid as part of their approach to creating a better world in order to serve their communities. Urban Indigenous Collective, which is referenced on the "About" page, is such an example.
4. GLOBAL POLITICS: Hyperlocal networks of mutual aid are one way that these reciprocal relationships occur. But they also occur in transnational spaces, particularly online but also sometimes when people meet at conferences, United Nations meetings, while traveling, etc. If you have seen crowdfunding for people to give money for people to survive state and nonstate terror, violence, and displacement,  and if you felt moved to donate money, you are participating in charity---but you are doing so TO a mutual aid network where people known to each other and building relationships with each other are using the resources you gave to share with those they personally know are in trouble. Maybe you could get to know the people near you who are part of those networks, and maybe you could build relationships with them.
