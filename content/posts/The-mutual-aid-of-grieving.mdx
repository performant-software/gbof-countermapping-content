I wander around my neighborhood, Bay Ridge, slipping in and out of encounters and conversations where people are crying or holding back tears. I see a package of unopened diapers on a stoop, amongst books and items being given away. I grab it and stick in my tote bag to give to my friend who promised to take supplies to the families being held at Floyd Bennett air field. Oops. I forgot to ask Maya if she knew someone who could speak K'iche' or Mam, because the people showing up to build community with the asylum seekers are speaking Spanish. But some of the people are indigenous Guatemalans and they are rightfully offended that everyone assumes they primarily speak Spanish. More than oops. I screwed up. I want to blame NYC government but I was the one who thought mutual aid could be a bit better. I got distracted by work, and I screwed up. I text Maya to apologize. I text my other friend that I have diapers. I am depleted and want to scream, but I keep walking with my tote bag.

Then, a Palestinian friend sees me at the bakery. We don't recognize each other at first because we got to know each other during the pandemic, behind masks and text messages and facebook groups. She hesitates and then invites me to a grieving circle for those whose relatives are dead or missing due to Israeli bombardment of Gaza. She says, maybe we should recite poetry. The poets are not afraid of kings, God(desses),rulers. It is the other way around. I tell her, yes, I will sit with anyone who is grieving and mourning. She looks surprised.

At the circle, people gather. I recognize several neighbors, some from yoga classes, others from events at the library.

When Nada finishes reading, she holds her sister's hand. They tilt their heads together and I see one big cascade of black hair. 40 members of their family are dead. Others are missing.

I ask the others how it felt to be there. They say, at least it doesn't cost anything. At least somebody acts like they care. At least we are not the enemy here. We tried to find therapists, but it's too frightening. People we thought were our friends call us names. So at least we have this. But, I want my grandmother. No one here can be my grandmother.

All of this happened in one week, in Bay Ridge. You can see our parks on the map and think, what a great place to raise a family. But you would miss so much about what is actually going on.

Naomi Shihab Nye wrote the poem, "Torn Map"

Once, by mistake,

she tore a map in half.

She taped it back, but crookedly.

Now all the roads ended in water.

There were mountains

right next to her hometown.

Wouldn't it be nice

if that were true?

I'd tear a map

and be right next to you.

***

What if I tore this map on purpose? How would I put it back together? How would I put us all back together?
